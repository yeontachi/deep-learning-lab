# 🧠 Deep Learning Lab

This repository serves as a personal laboratory for deep learning experimentation, research practice, and hands-on model implementation. It includes a variety of neural network experiments using PyTorch and other open-source tools, focusing on understanding model behavior through architectural variations, dataset manipulations, and training strategies.

## 🔀 Branch-Based Experiment Tracking

Each branch in this repository represents a distinct deep learning experiment or assignment. This approach keeps the main branch clean while allowing isolated and reproducible experiment management.

### 📁 Branch Naming Convention:
- `mnist-mlp-baseline`: Basic MLP on MNIST
- `mnist-cnn-compare`: CNN vs. MLP comparison
- `data-augmentation-test`: Experimenting with input noise, rotation, etc.
- `openpose-study`: Open source project analysis

> ✅ To view a specific experiment, switch to the corresponding branch.
